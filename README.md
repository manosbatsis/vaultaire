Query DSL and data access utilities for Corda developers.   

See complete documentation at https://manosbatsis.github.io/vaultaire

## Query DSL

Use DSL will make your queries much easier to read and maintain. 
Each query DSL is automatically (re)generated at build time using annotation
processing.

Usage example:

```kotlin
val queryCriteria: QueryCriteria = booksQuery {
    and {
    	// Check publisher?
        if(checkPublisher) fields.publisher `==` "Corda Books Ltd."
        or {
            fields.title  `==` "A book on Corda"
            fields.author `!=` "John Doe"
        }
    }
    orderBy {
        fields.title sort DESC
    }
}.toCriteria()
```

## RSQL Plugin

A plugin with support for [RSQL](https://www.baeldung.com/rest-api-search-language-rsql-fiql), 
a URL-friendly query language for dynamic, complex queries and 
maintenance-free REST endpoints for searching the Vault.

For more details see [RSQL Support](https://manosbatsis.github.io/vaultaire/plugins/rsql-support/).

## Accounts Plugin

A plugin for adding Corda Accounts support to Vaultaire's runtime and build-time modules.

For more details see [Corda Accounts](https://manosbatsis.github.io/vaultaire/plugins/corda-accounts/).

## State Services

Vaultaire's `StateService` interface provide a simple, consistent API to
load, query and track vault states.

`StateService` implementations are usually auto-generated at build time
and specific to a single `ContractState` type.

State Services can also decouple you code from `ServiceHub` and `CordaRPCOps`
amd help increase code reuse between cordapps and their clients.

For more details see [State Services](https://manosbatsis.github.io/vaultaire/core/state-services/).

## State DTOs

Maintaining Data Transfer Objects for your contract states can be a mundane, error-prone task. 
Vaultaireâ€™s annotation processing automates this by (re)generating those DTOs for you.

## Other Utils

Vaultaire includes a few other utilities like:

- REST-friendly pages for query results.
- Annotation to generate responder flows from commonly used supertypes.
